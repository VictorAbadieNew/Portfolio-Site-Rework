            <p class="projecttext">If you were to ask me three years ago, if I'd see myself engaged to the love of my life, the father of an incredible 7 month old baby boy named Ezra and 6 year old baby girl named Bella, and living a life I've dreamed of and worked for since becoming an adult, I'd call you insane! My life is exactly that though, this balanced, peaceful, and joyful existence. </p>
            <p class="projecttext">My fiance', Bri, is in my unbiased opinion (:p), is the most spectacular human walking the face of the Earth. She is beautiful, she's brilliant, but she also deals with my dumbass, and loves me in a way I never thought possible. She blessed me with two beautiful children that are so full of life and GENUINELY happy. Everyone always pictures themselves having kids, but until you do, you don't understand the way in which it changes you. I've always wanted to be a better man and a better human, but now, I know that I owe it to the world to make sure that my kiddos grow up to be the best versions of themselves and hopefully impact the world in even more amazing ways than I plan.  </p>

</div>
            <p class="projecttext">Music is the glue that has held my life together and I mean that in a more literal sense than one may think. Music, for as long as I can remember, has seen me through things that I didn't know I could make it through. Artists that I have never met (and some that I have) have made me feel like I wasn't alone in a world in times that can so easily make you feel small. Music has connected me with so many people in my life, that the list of people that haven't come into my life because of it is probably shorter. I'm even working on playing the guitar myself, because I'm not fantastic at expressing myself, but maybe this is an outlet that will finally help with that!  </p>
            <p class="projecttext">Ive been to 600+ Shows, Festivals, and concerts, I've met my favorite band AND made my way onto their tour bus for drinks after their show one night, and I've seen legendary performances more than once! My favorite music probably falls into softer / indie rock (Portugal. The Man, Glass Animals, The Black Keys, Pink Floyd, etc) but I have a passion for hip-hop too! The more lyrical the artist, the better, because rappers are some of the best poets to ever exist.</p>
